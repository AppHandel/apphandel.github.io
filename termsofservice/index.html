      and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).
      <br><br>This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same, except Content not shared
      publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the Handel Services. Some of the Handel Services are supported by advertising revenue and may
      display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Handel may place such advertising and promotions on the Handel Services or on, about,

      publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and
      <br>3. the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all
